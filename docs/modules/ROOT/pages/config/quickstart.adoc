= Configuration Quickstart

Certificates for users, hosts and gateways are issued by a fictitious
strongSwan CA. In our example scenarios the CA certificate `strongswanCert.pem`
must be present on all VPN endpoints in order to be able to authenticate the
peers. For your particular VPN application you can either use certificates from
any third-party CA or generate the needed private keys and certificates yourself
with the strongSwan xref:pki/pki.adoc[`*pki*`] tool, the use of which is explained
in the xref:pki/pkiQuickstart.adoc[certificates quickstart] section.

== Site-to-Site Case

In this scenario two security gateways `*moon*` and `*sun*` will connect the
two subnets `*moon-net*` and `*sun-net*` with each other through a VPN tunnel
set up between the two gateways:

    10.1.0.0/16 -- | 192.168.0.1 | === | 192.168.0.2 | -- 10.2.0.0/16
      moon-net          moon                 sun           sun-net

Configuration on gateway `*moon*`:
----
/etc/swanctl/x509ca/strongswanCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/x509/moonCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/private/moonKey.pem

/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf:

  connections {
    net-net {
      remote_addrs = 192.168.0.2
      local {
        auth = pubkey
        certs = moonCert.pem
      }
      remote {
        auth = pubkey
        id = "C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN=sun.strongswan.org"
      }
      children {
        net-net {
          local_ts  = 10.1.0.0/16
          remote_ts = 10.2.0.0/16
          start_action = trap
        }
      }
    }
  }

Configuration on gateway `*sun*`:

/etc/swanctl/x509/sunCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/private/sunKey.pem

/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf:

      local {

        certs = sunCert.pem
      }
      remote {
        auth = pubkey
        id = "C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN=moon.strongswan.org"
      }
      children {
        net-net {
          local_ts  = 10.2.0.0/16
          remote_ts = 10.1.0.0/16
          start_action = trap
        }
      }
    }
  }
----
The `*local*` and `*remote*` identities used in this scenario are the
`*subjectDistinguishedNames*` (DNs) contained in the end entity certificates.
The certificates and private keys are loaded into the
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon with the command

 swanctl --load-creds

whereas

 swanctl --load-conns

loads the connections defined in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_connections[`*swanctl.conf*`]. With
`*start_action = trap*` the IPsec connection is automatically set up with the
first plaintext payload IP packet wanting to go through the tunnel.

== Host-to-Host Case

This is a setup between two single hosts which don't have a subnet behind
them.  Although IPsec transport mode would be sufficient for host-to-host
connections we will use the default IPsec tunnel mode.

    | 192.168.0.1 | === | 192.168.0.2 |

== Roadwarrior Case

This is a very common case where a strongSwan gateway serves an arbitrary
number of remote VPN clients usually having dynamic IP addresses.

    10.1.0.0/16 -- | 192.168.0.1 | === | x.x.x.x |
      moon-net          moon              carol

Configuration on gateway `*moon*`:
----
/etc/swanctl/x509ca/strongswanCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/x509/moonCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/private/moonKey.pem

/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf:

  connections {
    rw {
      local {
        auth = pubkey
        certs = moonCert.pem
        id = moon.strongswan.org
      }
      remote {
        auth = pubkey
      }
      children {
        rw {
          local_ts  = 10.1.0.0/16
        }
      }
    }
  }
----

Configuration on roadwarrior `*carol*`:
----
/etc/swanctl/x509ca/strongswanCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/x509/carolCert.pem
/etc/swanctl/private/carolKey.pem

/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf:

  connections {
    home {
      remote_addrs = moon.strongswan.org
      local {
        auth = pubkey
          certs = carolCert.pem
          id = carol@strongswan.org
        }
      remote {
        auth = pubkey
        id = moon.strongswan.org
      }
      children {
        home {
          local_ts  = 10.1.0.0/16
          start_action = start
        }
      }
    }
  }
----
For `*remote_addrs*` the hostname `*moon.strongswan.org*` was chosen which will be
resolved by DNS at runtime into the corresponding IP destination address.
In this scenario the identity of the roadwarrior `*carol*` is the email address
`*carol@strongswan.org*` which must be included as a `*subjectAltName*` in
the roadwarrior certificate `*carolCert.pem*`.


== Roadwarrior Case with Virtual IP

Roadwarriors usually have dynamic IP addresses assigned by the ISP they are
currently attached to.  In order to simplify the routing from `*moon-net*` back
to the remote access client `*carol*` it would be desirable if the roadwarrior had
an inner IP address chosen from a pre-defined pool.

    10.1.0.0/16 -- | 192.168.0.1 | === | x.x.x.x | -- 10.3.0.1
      moon-net          moon              carol       virtual IP

In our example the virtual IP address is chosen from the address pool
`*10.3.0.0/16*` which can be configured by adding the section
----
  pools {
    rw_pool {
      addrs = 10.3.0.0/16
    }
  }
----
to the gateway's xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_pools[`*swanctl.conf*`] from where
they are loaded into the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon using the
command

 swanctl --load-pools

To request an IP address from this pool a roadwarrior can use IKEv1 mode config
or IKEv2 configuration payloads. The configuration for both is the same

 vips = 0.0.0.0

Configuration on gateway `*moon*`:
----

        auth = pubkey

----

== Roadwarrior Case with EAP

This is a very common case where a strongSwan gateway serves an arbitrary
number of remote VPN clients which authenticate themselves via a password-based
*Extended Authentication Protocol* as e.g. `EAP-MD5` or `EAP-MSCHAPv2`.

    10.1.0.0/16 -- | 192.168.0.1 | === | x.x.x.x |

== Roadwarrior Case with EAP Identity

Often a client EAP identity is exchanged via EAP which differs from the
external IKEv2 identity. In this example the IKEv2 identity defaults to
the IPv4 address of the client.

== Passthrough/bypass policies

Passthrough or bypass policies allow excluding specific traffic from IPsec
processing.

=== For a local LAN

To automatically install passthrough policies for locally connected subnets,
the xref:plugins/bypass-lan.adoc[`*bypass-lan*` plugin] may be used.

The following is a manual passthrough policy that applies to packets from and
to the `*10.0.0.0/8*` subnet. `*remote_addrs*` is set to `*127.0.0.1*` to
prevent this connection from being considered if a peer connects.

----
/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf:

  connections {
    passthrough-lan {
      remote_addrs = 127.0.0.1

----

=== For arbitrary subnets/addresses

The following is a passthrough policy that applies to packets that are sent
from an address in `*192.168.2.0/24*` to an address in `*10.1.0.0/24*` or
vice-versa.
